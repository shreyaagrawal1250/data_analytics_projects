# Data Analytics: Forecasting, Automation and Business Intelligence Portfolio
By Shreya Agrawal

> 🚧 **Portfolio Status:** Currently migrating and sanitizing historical project code from my 8-month internship at Heelium Sports. New modules for Forecasting and Automation  are being added daily. Last Updated: Feb 2026.

This repository centralizes my technical work in statistical modeling, business process automation, and data visualization from my tenure as a Data Analyst Intern in my previous organisation. My work focuses on bridging the gap between raw data and strategic business decisions—leveraging a background in **Business Statistics** and **4 cleared Actuarial Exams (IAI)**.

## 📁 Portfolio Structure

* **[Forecasting-Models/](https://github.com/shreyaagrawal1250/data_analytics_projects/tree/main/forecasting-models)**
    * **Goal:** Comparing time-series models (SARIMA, Prophet, Holt-Winters, GLM) to optimize purchase order decisions for stategic inventory management and pricing.
    * **Impact:** Reduced forecast error to 5-10% and automated purchase order workflows.
* **[Automation-Scripts/](https://github.com/shreyaagrawal1250/data_analytics_projects/tree/main/Automation-Scripts)**
    * **Goal:** End-to-end data pipelines using Python, SQL, and Google Apps Script.
    * **Impact:** Saved 10+ manual hours/week and eliminated data entry errors in financial reporting.
* **[Dashboards/](https://github.com/shreyaagrawal1250/data_analytics_projects/tree/main/Dashboards)**
    * **Goal:** Monitoring SKU-level risk and contribution margins using Looker Studio.
    * **Impact:** Provided stakeholders with real-time visibility into high-risk/low-margin products.

## 🛠 Technical Toolkit

| Domain | Proficiency |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Actuarial Science** | Exams Cleared: 4, GLM Frameworks, Risk Modeling, Pricing Analysis|
| **Data Science (Python)** | Pandas, Statsmodels, Prophet, Scikit-learn (Regression/Random Forest) |
| **Automation & APIs** | Google Apps Script, REST APIs, Gspread |
| **BI & Visualization** | Google Looker Studio, Google Sheets, Power BI (Learning) |


## 📈 Key Project Spotlight: Demand Forecasting Logic
In my tenure at Heelium Sports, I developed a model selection logic that chose the optimal algorithm based on data density and seasonality:
* **SARIMA:** Utilized for high-seasonality products with 24+ months of history.
* **Holt-Winters:** Applied to baseline items with steady growth trends.
* **Prophet:** Used for volatile new launches with irregular data points.
